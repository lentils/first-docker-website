# First web project

This is my first crack at web development. I'll be following along [Mozilla's
guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) and building off of
that. Hopefully other newbies can also get some useful information from my example.

## Docker

Another goal was to understand how web-servers work. Since Docker is the Hot New Thing, why not
leverage it to make a standalone project?
